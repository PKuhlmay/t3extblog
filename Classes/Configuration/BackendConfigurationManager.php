     * Needed basically to make extbase work. Without PID is set to 0 (which is root)
     * and persistence, TS generation, etc. will fail. This is the case in TYPO3 8.x
     * and 9.x when editing a record using the context menu (t3js-clickmenutrigger CSS
     * class). Example: right click on a record in the BE module, click edit, change
     * visibility which should trigger emails but does not.
     *
     * Using a issueCommand VH link works as expected. Not needed for TYPO3 7.x.
