Since TYPO3 9.5.15 the old post URL structure (`yyyy/mm/dd/my-post-title`) is possible again.

**Override the routing**

.. code-block::

   routeEnhancers:
     T3extblogBlogsystemPlugin:
       aspects:
         post_title:
           datePrefix: 'Y/m/d/'


**htaccess redirect**

This will work for the default routing:

.. code-block::

   RewriteRule ^blog/article/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(.+)$ /blog/article/$1/$2/$3/$4 [R=301,NC,L]

How to upgrade
""""""""""""""

#. Use "Compare database" in install tool to adjust changed DB fields

#. Run "Create missing post URL slugs" update wizard in extension manager (you might need to do this multiple times!)

#. Run "Create missing category URL slugs" update wizard in extension manager (you might need to do this multiple times!)

#. Add extension :ref:`routing configuration <configuration-speaking-url>` to your site configuration

#. Make sure your site configuration has an absolute URL as "Entry Point" (or base) configured (so no `/` but
   something like `https://domain.com/`. Otherwise TYPO3 will NOT RENDER ABSOLUTE URLs in email templates!

#. Add a htaccess rule for redirecting old post URLs to the new one (see "URL redirect" below)

#. Update your TS and TSconfig includes if needed

#. Update your TS linkhandler configuration if needed

#. Add "Sitemap setup" static TS to your template in order to enable :ref:`SEO sitemap support <faq-sitemap>`

#. Clear all caches


**URL redirect**

This will work for the default routing:

.. code-block::

   RewriteRule ^blog/article/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d{2})/(.+)$ /blog/article/$1-$2-$3-$4 [R=301,NC,L]

Please note that it is now possible to configure the URLs as you wish, even without a date!
